# RaspberryPi-Prom

This was made as part of a group to show off different functionality on a Raspberry Pi. I wrote all the software here, and  other people worked on the hardware and interfaces.

When the raspberry pi was connected to the computer, the right python file would be called from the console. The main ones were:
Final.py <br>
bugdetectmult.py <br>
